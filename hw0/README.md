# CSE320 Spring 2018

In this course we will be using Linux as your primary development
environment. In addition, we will be providing you with a git
repository hosted on a department GitLab server. This document will
briefly explain the course tools and outline the required setup for
this course.

## Setting up your CSE320 Git repository

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. We will use
git repositories to manage your homework submissions. In addition, the
use of git allows the Professor and TAs to access and view your your
code remotely in order to assist you. While some students may be
familiar with version control and git, we ask that everyone complete
the following tutorial and instructions. This will ensure that
everyone in the course has the same background knowledge and can
submit their homeworks.

We are using a CSE department supported git web interface, called
gitlab. This is similar to github, bitbucket, etc. It is an interface
to help manage git repositories. These services are INTERFACES to git,
not git itself.  You *may not* use external repositories as we will
use the repo provided to you to grade your submitted work and share
gradesheets with you.

To setup your repository:

1. Navigate to
[https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu](https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/)
and log into it with you CS email account (user name only, do not
include the `@cs.stonybrook.edu`). If you forgot your CS email
password you can reset it by following the instructions
[here](https://auth02.cs.stonybrook.edu:10443/react/). If those
instructions fail, please email `rt@cs.stonybrook.edu` requesting a
password reset. A response may take up to 24-48 hours.
2. Once logged in you will receive an email to your
`@cs.stonybrook.edu` acct when your repo is created.

## Setting up Linux Environment

Since C is a systems level language, frequently the behavior from one
person’s computer to another can vary. In the past, we have provided a
common server for students to use, but this presented a few
problems. When you wanted to compile your assignment, you would have
to continuously transfer the file to the server and then compile
it. If you had any mistakes, you would have to either edit it on the
server or make the change locally and upload it again. This became
very tedious which often lead to students compiling and testing
locally on their own machines. This was not always a good idea as
something that seemed to work for you didn’t always work for the
grader which caused many issues. Also, many tools, which assist in
locating and fixing errors in C code, do not exist in Windows and OSX
environments. So students who installed operating systems such as
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) were at an advantage over
the students who did not.

> :nerd: This document will also outline the homework management and
  submission process. In this class, you will be creating increasingly
  complex C projects which may involve many files. To satisfy these
  requirements, we will be using git to manage & submit your homework
  assignments

> :nerd: While we will try to provide the basics for what needs to be
  done, it will ultimately be up to you to learn how to use these
  tools.

To help alleviate the above issues and to setup a local environment
with the necessary course tools, you must install your working
environment using one of these two options:

- Option 1: A Virtual Machine running Linux (Encouraged Option)
- Option 2: Multi-Boot/Install Linux on your machine

Option 1 is encouraged for the following reasons:
- Quick setup
- Ease of use in your native OS
- Easy to reset if errors in VM environment
- All course tools are pre-installed
- Simulate multiple cores on a single core system

We have put a lot of effort into setting up a pre-configured VM.  If
for some reason you are unable or unwilling to use this, we have
provided basic instructions for Option 2 with a script to install all
the course tools.

If you choose option 2, you should have some idea what you are doing,
already be comfortable with Linux, and be aware that we probably won't
have the resources to debug any issues you might encounter.  If you
deviate in any other way from these procedures, it is completely at
your peril.

### Option 1: A Virtual Machine running Linux

Students often use either [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) or
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run virtual machines.
Although last semester we recommended VMWare, this semester we are
instead recommending Virtualbox.  Virtualbox is free, and it runs
on all of the most popular platforms.

In order to run a virtual machine, your machine must support 64-bit
hardware virtualization. Most machines built after 2006 should support
this. However, not all machines have the option enabled. You may need
to modify your BIOS settings to enable this feature. As each machine
has a different BIOS, it is up to you to find and enable this feature
on your own machine.

Download and install the VirtualBox platform package appropriate
for your computer from [this site](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

#### Running the Linux VM

We will be using Linux Mint 18.3 "Sylvia" as this semester's OS. We
have taken the time to set up the VM so it simply needs to be opened
in your virtualization program.  The provided Linux virtual machine
has all the tools required for various aspects of this course; for
example, homework submission is pre-installed.

To get started, download the VM from here:
[https://goo.gl/g7P2B9](https://goo.gl/g7P2B9)
(it's about 3 gb so give it some time).
This should result in your having a file called **CSE320_Spring18.ova**.
This can be imported directly into VirtualBox by choosing
"Import Appliance" from the "File" menu and then browsing to select
the file you downloaded.  Click "Next", review the VM settings,
and then click on "Import".  Once the import has completed, you should
have a VM called "CSE 320 Spring 2018".  Select this and click on
"Start" to boot the VM.

#### Login Info

Upon booting, a login screen will be displayed.  The user name is
selected automatically for you, but you will need to enter the password.
The login info for your reference is:


|     Username    |   Password   |
|:----------------|:-------------|
|    `student`    |   `cse320`   |

#### VM Snapshots

If you choose to install additional tools or other programs to your
environment, you may want to take a snapshot of your VM. This may save
you the time of installing your additional software again, in the
unfortunate event of an unusable VM. Refer to the appropriate VirtualBox
documentation to learn to take a snapshot of your VM.

### Option 2: Multi-Boot/Install Linux on your machine

Install [Linux Mint 18.3 "Sylvia" 64-bit](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=246)
or 16.04 Ubuntu variant (as long as you are using gcc 5.4.0) as a dual-boot or fresh
install.

Clone the [CSE320 course tools](https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse320/course_tools)
(https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse320/course_tools) repository
into your Linux environment. You may need to install git.

Follow the README in the `course_tools` repo.

> Remember, if you choose this option, you should have some idea what
  you are doing, already be comfortable with Linux, and be aware that
  we probably won't have the resources to debug any issues you might
  encounter.  If you deviate in any other way from these procedures,
  it is completely at your peril.

#### Working in Unix

We understand that many of the students taking this class are new to
CLI (Command-line interface). You can find a quick crash course
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html.

> :nerd: For more advanced usage refer
  [here](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-lpic1-103-1/). This
  is a REALLY good resource so we recommend bookmarking it for later
  reference.

> :nerd: Depending on the host system on which you installed VirtualBox,
  "keyboard integration" and "mouse integration" might or might not be
  supported.  If they are supported, then you will be able to fairly
  seamlessly move your mouse in and out of the VM window and what you
  type on the keyboard will go to the proper place.  If these features
  are not supported, then you will need to click on the VM window in
  order to use it, at which point the mouse and keyboard will be "captured"
  by the VM.  In order to regain control of the mouse and cursor, you
  will need to press the "host key", which is identified at the right-hand
  side of the bottom icon tray of the VirtualBox window.  On some systems,
  the default host key is "Right Ctrl".

> :nerd: To open a terminal window, you can click on the terminal
  icon (which should be fairly evident), or you can press CTRL + ALT + T.

#### Text Editor

A _good_ basic text editor is the key for C development.

We have pre-installed Sublime Text with plugins such as a C linter to
assist with C development on the given VM. A linter displays compiler
errors on top of your code much like an IDE. If you do install another
editor we recommend looking into a similar feature described as it
will aid development.

You may use another text editor if you so desire. Some popular ones
are Atom, Vim, Emacs and VSCode. Each have their own linter's that you
can look into installing.

**DO NOT** install and use a full IDE (Clion, Netbeans, or Eclipse);
  there are many parts of the compilation process that are hidden from
  you. Not only would you miss out on valuable information pertinent
  to the course but your project is not guaranteed to build in an
  environment separate from the IDE.

## Homework Management & Submission

#### Setting up your CSE320 repository

Once your repository has been created on gitlab (email received), you
must clone it in your Linux environment. Open a new terminal window
and type `git clone GIT_URL`. You should replace `GIT_URL` with the
URL to your repository. You can find it by navigating to your projects
webpage and selecting the https option.

> Your repo should be cloned into your home directory (`/home/student/` or AKA `~/`)

  Alternatively if you add an ssh-key to your gitlab account you can
  clone, pull, push, etc. using the URL under the SSH option (**highly
  recommended** An SSH key can be done at any time).

  References:
    - [Generating SSH key](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html)
    - [Adding SSH key to Gitlab](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html)

#### First Commit to your Repo

Open a terminal from the home directory enter the following command:
(replacing REPO_NAME with your repo's name)

<pre>
$ subl REPO_NAME
</pre>

The text editor, Sublime, will open and your repo's contents will be
show on the sidebar. Open the `README.md` file and add the text with
the following information relevant to you.

```markdown
# FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME
## ID_NUMBER
:FAVORITE_EMOJI:
PROFESSOR_NAME - SECTION_NUMBER
```

You can find your favorite emoji code among these
[http://emoji.codes/](http://emoji.codes/). After that you can save
and close the file and return to your terminal.

In your terminal, type the following commands, replacing `EMAIL` with
your CS email address and `NAME` with your name:

**NOTE:** This will change your settings for all repos if you want to
  have different settings for other repos on your machine then omit
  `--global`

<pre>
$ git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
$ git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
$ git config --global push.default simple
</pre>

Change directories into your repo `cd REPO_NAME`

Then run the following commands:

<pre>
$ git status
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "My First Commit"
$ git push
</pre>

> The `git push` command will prompt for username and password if you used HTTPS.

The output will look **similar** to:

<pre>
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add file..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- file..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "My First Commit"
[master XXXXXXX] My First Commit
 1 files changed, X insertions(+), X deletions(-)
$ git push
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 980 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To ssh://git@gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu:130/CSE320_Spring18/REPONAME.git
   XXXXXXX..XXXXXXX  master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
$
</pre>

This is the basic usage of git. We check the `status` of which files
are tracked/untracked. Then we `add` them and we `commit` them along
with a message. Lastly and most importantly we `push` them to the
remote repository on the gitlab server. If the push was successful,
you can navigate back to the page `https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu`
and select your repository. Inside your repository, select the files
option on the left menu. You should now see the file `README.md` with
the contents you added to it.

#### Git Tutorial

We recommend you complete Codecademy’s git tutorial found
[here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) if you are
unfamilar with git.

If you’re interested in learning more information about git or
expanding your knowledge, refer to these references:

# Homework 0

#### Obtaining Assignment Code

1. Navigate to your repository directory (`cd ~/REPO_NAME`) in your VM
(using the terminal).

2. An assignment, such as this one, will tell you the code is located
at a particular address. For `hw0` it is:
`https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse320/hw0.git`

3. Add this remote repository as an additional remote into your
existing repository. We will name the new remote HW0_CODE.

    If you use HTTPS:

    ```
    $ git remote add HW0_CODE https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse320/hw0.git
    ```

    If you use SSH:

    ```
    $ git remote add HW0_CODE ssh://git@gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu:130/cse320/hw0.git
    ```

4. Fetch all the refs in this new repository. This command will prompt
for username and password if you used HTTPS.

    ```
    $ git fetch HW0_CODE
    ```

5. Finally, merge and commit the files from the `HW0_CODE` remote's
`master` branch into your existing repository’s `master` branch.

    ```
    $ git merge -m "Merging HW0_CODE" HW0_CODE/master
    ```

    > :nerd: If you get an error mentioning 'unrelated histories' try
      again adding this flag: `--allow-unrelated-histories`

6. If you type the command `ls` you should now see a directory called `hw0`.

7. Push these base files to your remote repository (gitlab). This
command will prompt for username and password if you used HTTPS.

    ```
    $ git push
    ```

#### Your Homework 0 Working Directory

The directory structure of your repo will now look **similar** to
this. Use `ls -a` or `tree -a` to see the hidden files that begin with
`.`

<pre>
YOUR_REPO
├── .git
│   ├── ...
├── .gitignore
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
├── hw0
│   ├── academic_honesty.txt
│   ├── include
│   │   └── hi.h
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── hi.c
│   │   └── main.c
│   └── tests
│       └── test.c
└── README.md
</pre>

Information about each file is explained below.

> :nerd: Enter `subl REPO_NAME` (or `subl .` if you are in your repo
  already) as you did before to easily follow along and look inside
  each file

- `.gitignore` - This is a file that tells git to ignore certain
  directories or files that you don't want committed. For example, the
  `bin` and `build` directories, and the `README.md` file are
  ignored. This is because we don't want executables, binary files and
  redundant documentation pushed to your remote repository, only
  source code.
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` This is gitlab's own continuous integration
  configuration file, explained in a later section.
- `hw0/` - This is your first homework directory, throughout the
  semester we'll be adding each homework directory in this fashion
  'hw#' where # is the homework number. Inside the `hw0/` directory,
  you will find:
    - `README.md` - This is a file where you can detail notes about the project.
    - `Makefile` - This is your ultimate compilation automation
      tool. The program `make` will use this file to properly compile
      your assignment.
    - `include/` - This is where we keep our `.h` headers. Unlike
      Java, C is a one pass compilation language, which keeps the
      overhead of creating symbol tables and structures low. Since all
      functions must be defined before use, we utilize a header file
      to make the symbols available across multiple files.
        - `hi.h` - This is our header file for `hw0`. **Examine the
          contents of this file.**
    - `src/` - This is where we keep our `.c` source files. These
      files contain the actual definitions of the functions declared
      in our headers.
        - `main.c` - This file contains the C main function, in this
          course you will **ALWAYS** need to keep your main function
          in its own C file isolated from the rest of your functions
          that you implement.
        - `hi.c` - The helper function, `hi`, is defined (implemented)
          here. Each function **does not** need its own file, only
          `main()` needs to be in its own file.
    - `tests/` - This is where we keep our unit tests. There is an
      EXCELLENT unit testing framework called
      [criterion](http://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/intro.html)
      that we will be using in the course.
        - `test.c` - This file contains the implementation of our
          testing framework. The Makefile will compile these files
          with all of the non-`main.c` files. This gives the testing
          framework access to your helper functions.

> **Do not** modify or alter `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `Makefile` or the
    `README.md` for any assignment unless otherwise instructed.

### Academic Honesty Statement

In this course we take Academic Honesty EXTREMELY seriously. Read the
statement in `academic_honesty.txt` using your favorite text editor or
using the following command (type `man cat` for more information on
this tool).

From your repository's root directory type:
<pre>
$ cat hw0/academic_honesty.txt
</pre>

Next, we will append the Academic Honesty Statement into your
repository's README along with the date and your "signature"
confirming that you have read the statement and agree with the policy
and commit it to your repo.

From your repository's root directory type the following commands into
your terminal, filling in `YOUR_NAME` with the appropriate information
in the second command.

> :nerd: The second "crazy" command is an example of redirection which
  can be done between programs on the command-line. We will learn more
  about redirection and how it works later in the semester.

<pre>
$ cd hw0
$ cat academic_honesty.txt &lt;(echo "$(date -u) - YOUR_NAME") >> ../README.md
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Academic Honesty statement"
$ git push
</pre>

#### CI File

This semester we want to ensure that student's don't get caught by
silly mistakes or overlook anything while working on their
assignments. We will use GitLab's [_Continuous
Integration_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
feature to minimize such incidents. It is an automated tool that will
make sure your work compiles and passes basic tests.

There is a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the base code. This file is used
to set up a clean vm, compile your code, run your unit tests, and
lastly run your program on the gitlab server. When looking on gitlab
you will notice a red :x: or green :heavy_check_mark:. Each represents
the result of a 'ci pipeline'. Go to the Pipelines tab to view the
results of your run. We will provide this file with each homework. The
CI runs when gitlab "gets around" to doing it so don't be alarmed if
you don't see your result right away.

#### Hello, World!

In the terminal, navigate into the `hw0` folder of your repository
(ie. `~/REPO_NAME/hw0/`). Open the file `include/hi.h` and examine its
contents, read the comments, and follow the directions in the
files. These directions step you through the base files in the HW to
familiarize you with basic files structure and the included code
complements.

In the terminal, type `make` to build the `hw0` base code. This will
compile your c code into executables.

<pre>
$ make
mkdir -p bin build
gcc build/hi.o build/main.o -o bin/hi
gcc -Wall -Werror -std=gnu11 -g -DDEBUG -I include build/hi.o tests/test.c -lcriterion -o bin/hi_test
</pre>

An executable named `hi` and `hi_test` will be created in the `bin`
folder of the `hw0` directory.  You can execute either program by
typing `bin/hi` or `bin/hi_test` from the `hw0` directory into the
terminal.

Running `bin/hi` will print "Hello, World!" before exiting.  Running
`bin/hi_test` will fail a unit test and print the warning `"Assertion
failed: say_hi() function did not say 'Hi'"`.

<pre>
$ bin/hi
Hello, World!
$ bin/hi_test
[----] tests/test.c:15: Assertion failed: say_hi() function did not say 'Hi'
[FAIL] CSE320_Suite::test_it_really_does_say_hi: (0.00s)
[====] Synthesis: Tested: 1 | Passing: 0 | Failing: 1 | Crashing: 0
</pre>

To do this assignment, modify the `say_hi()` function in `src/hi.c` to
satisfy the unit test (i.e. `return "Hi"`). This is will now make the
program do what the unit test expects and as a result pass the unit
test.

Rebuild the hw0 executables by typing in ‘make’ to your terminal. Run
the program again to make sure it satisfies requirements

<pre>
$ make
mkdir -p bin build
gcc -Wall -Werror -std=gnu11 -g -DDEBUG -I include -c -o build/hi.o src/hi.c
gcc build/hi.o build/main.o -o bin/hi
gcc -Wall -Werror -std=gnu11 -g -DDEBUG -I include build/hi.o tests/test.c -lcriterion -o bin/hi_test
$ bin/hi
Hi, World!
$ bin/hi_test
[====] Synthesis: Tested: 1 | Passing: 1 | Failing: 0 | Crashing: 0
</pre>

To save your code changes, `add` them to the staging area of
git. `Commit` the changes to a local commit on your VM. Then `push`
the commits to the remote server (gitlab).

You can be sure that everything compiles correctly if at some point a
check appears next to your repo on gitlab.

<pre>
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add file..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- file..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   src/hi.c

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add src/hi.c
$ git commit -m "Hi Fix"
[master XXXXXXX] updated hi.c
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ git push
Username for 'https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu': REPO_NAME
Password for 'https://REPO_NAME@gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu':
</pre>

## How to submit with `git submit`

This semester you will be submitting all assignments using our custom
git command: `git submit`

The usage for `git submit` is:

<pre>
$ git submit [-c COMMIT_HASH] TAG
</pre>

The **TAG** is which assignment you are tagging, for example: `hw0` or
`hw1` or `hw2`. This is the format for all tags (with a few
exceptions) that we will use this semester `hw#` where `#` is the
assignment number.

The `-c` flag is optional. **COMMIT** is the SHA of the commit you
wish to submit. In case you wanted to submit a different commit than
your most current one you would just provide the SHA for the commit to
be submitted. You can view your commit SHAs using the following
command:

> The SHA is the alphanumeric string before the first hyphen.

<pre>
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s - %ar"
</pre>

With `git submit`, you may:

* Submit your assignment **only** from the master branch.

* The commits that you are submitting must be on the master branch or
  merged into master (commit hash is on master).

* You may use other branches if you wish, but you cannot use
  git-submit from these branches.

<pre>
$ git submit hw0
</pre>

This will submit your latest pushed commit for `hw0`. You can submit
as many times as you wish prior to any deadline.

#### How to check your submission

It creates a special branch in your repo called 'submit'. The only
reason it is special is that only instructors have permission to push
to it, hence why you need a special tool to submit your assignment. So
the submit tool tags the commit that you want to submit and merges
that commit into the submit branch under an authorized user.

Also, you should see a submission commit on the 'submit' branch. The
submission commit is a commit with a commit message formatted as
"<tag-name> submission commit". This you can see by navigating to
Repository > Commits and selecting the 'submit' branch from the
dropdown.

If you see both of these things, you have successfully submitted the
assignment. A successfully submitted homework assignment will have a
tag for that particular homework which you can see if you go to your
project in Gitlab and navigate to Repository > Tags.

---------------------------------------------

These are the tools and the dev environment you will be working with
for the rest of the semester. We have provided you with these tools to
ease the protocols of this course and prevent mishaps from
occurring. That being said, some of these tools are still in beta and
you will have the the chance to give us feedback at the end of the
semester in the course evaluations.

If you managed all this by **January 26th, 2018** then you will
receive 2 extra credit points!
